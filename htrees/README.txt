README

For my HTree.cc, I often referred back to the date example that was used in the slides
for the changes I made after being based on my tree.hh file. For my test_tree, I used 
the date example as a base, but I did a lot of research online to lear how to properly
assign the left and right nodes of each tree.

For HForest, I followed the HTree layout for my hh file. In my cc, I looked online a lot
to gain an understanding of the make/pop heap functions. In test_hforest, I created a 
helper function to make trees and passed those trees to add_tree. The helper function
was a headache, but I was able to learn a lot more about the syntax of vectors and
after a while it did make things a lot easier.
